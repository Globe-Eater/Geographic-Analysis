# Welcome!

This repo is designed to provide python tools to conquer the Graduate level class Geographic Analysis.

# Setup:

The anaconda distirbution is how I am controlling the enviroment the code runs in.
If you have not doneso already please install anaconda on your device at:

    https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
    
Once installed please navigate to the dirctory that environment.yml is located.
Run the command:
        conda env create -f environment.yml
        
The enviroment will called tensorflow.
    
To activate the enviroment please run either:
        conda activate tensorflow
        
If you are on Mac or Linux: 
        
        source activate tensorflow
Windows:
	conda activate tensorflow


# Usage:

Do not copy my reports. You may reference them to compare answers and conclusions,
but under no circumstance should you ever copy verbatum my graphs, charts, and
disscussions. You are more than welcome to cite my work.

In this particular class students are assigned random variables each year.
What you should do is fork this code and change any and all variables to suit
your needs.
    
Due note this code was run in the Spyder IDE. I copied all the polts from the 
plot panel into the word file that is required for submission. 
    
To run spyder, open an anaconda prompt if you are using windows or a terminal
if you are on Mac or Linux.

Run these commands:
	source activate tensorflow

	spyder

This will open a new window with the Spyder integrated Devleopment Enviroment.
You can open the files from wherever you cloned or downloaded them from.

Here is the spyder docs, they can give a much better tour of it than what I can
here.
